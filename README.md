# Yocto Project Environment helper

This container is self-contained and we provide the wrapper script
inside it. To get it please run this very same container passing
wrapper as argument. For example:

    docker run zuhauseplattform/yocto-env:20.04 wrapper > ~/bin/yocto-env
    chmod a+x ~/bin/yocto-env

The generated wrapper, `yocto-env`, has the following usage message:
